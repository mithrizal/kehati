                    <p> </p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we gather from individuals visiting our website, <a href="www.kehati-shoes.com">www.kehati-shoes.com</a> ("Website"), and how we use that information.</p>
                    <p>By accessing our Website, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Website. Every time you visit our Website, your visit will be subject to the then-current version of this Privacy Policy. When you visit our Website, you should check the date of the Privacy Policy and review any changes that have been made since your last visit to our Website.</p>
                    <p><strong>You should read our <a href="<?php echo base_url("home/terms"); ?>" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> together with this Privacy Policy. By accessing our Website, you are acknowledging that both this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service apply to your use of this Website.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Information Collected by Us</strong></p>
                    <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," which are small electronic data files stored on a user's computer containing information about the user. Specific information we may collect automatically when you access our Website includes information such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, computer and connection information, internet browser type, operating system and platform. We may also collect the full URL (Uniform Resource Locator) clickstream including how you came to our Website, what you viewed, how long you stayed, and when you left, including the date and time. We also may place information in our emails to you (such as a web beacon) that allows us to measure our email deliverability and effectiveness. Finally, we may use software tools to help us analyze session information including response times, page interaction information (e.g., clicks, mouse-overs, and scrolling), and download errors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
                    <p>We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. The Google Analytics Terms of Service agreement is available online at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html</a>. The Google Privacy Policy is available online at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.</p>
                    <p><strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</strong></p>
                    <p>We do not, under any circumstances, knowingly collect information from anyone under 13 years of age. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s mobile app and Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@kehati-shoes.com">info@kehati-shoes.com</a>, and we will delete that information from our databases as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p>
                    <p><strong>E-mail Communications</strong></p>
                    <p>If you provide us with your e-mail address, we may communicate with you by e-mail. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, you may unsubscribe by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any kehati-shoes.com email or in the footer of the kehati-shoes.com website. We will not share your e-mail address with others without your consent.</p>
                    <p><strong>We Do Not Share Information About Our Customers</strong></p>
                    <p>We believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our users from baseless legal demands. That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.</p>
                    <p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong></p>
                    <p>Our Website might include links to other websites. While we do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these third-party websites, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of those websites, and we caution you to be aware of the privacy practices of all websites. Our Privacy Policy and other policies do not apply to any other website.</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong></p>
                    <p>Kehati does not track our Website visitors across third-party websites for the purpose of providing targeted advertising. Accordingly, Kehati does not respond to web-browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.</p>
                    <p>Some third-party sites do, however, keep track of your browsing activities when they provide you content so that they can tailor the content they send you. Therefore, you should consider setting the DNT signal on your browser so that these third parties know you do not want to be tracked.</p>
                    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                    <p>Please note that electronic communication, particularly email, is not necessarily secure against interception. Please do not send sensitive data (e.g., Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers) by email or web form.</p>
                    <p><strong>Terms of Service, Notices</strong></p>
                    <p>Whenever you visit our Website, your visit, and any dispute over our privacy policies is governed by this Policy and our Terms of Service, which includes certain limitations on damages, disputes, and choices of law.</p>
                    <p><strong>Revisions</strong></p>
                    <p>Since we continuously strive to improve our business and your experience on our Website, we may change this Privacy Policy and our <a href="<?php echo base_url("home/terms"); ?>" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>. Users of our Website will be notified of any changes to this Privacy Policy on our homepage. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information about your account. You should regularly access this section of our Website in order to review the most recent version of our Privacy Policy.</p>
