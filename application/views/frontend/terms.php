                    <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service. Such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>

                    <p>Kehati's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these terms and conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.

                    <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Kehati relating to the subject matter addressed herein and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, warranties, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p>You agree that if any dispute should arise between you and Kehati, you will bring your claim on an individual basis and waive your right to pursue any claim in a class action.</p>
